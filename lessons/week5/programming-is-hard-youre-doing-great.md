	* _Sometimes it took hours for me to figure the simplest things out, but I’d come to understand that the answer was out there, somewhere._
	* _But most importantly, I know that experience, though important, is not everything. The gap is not insurmountable because I have what it takes to learn._
	* _It’s not about what we already know, it’s about how we learn. It’s about the tenacity of sitting in front of a computer and googling until you find the right answer. It’s about staring at every line of code until you understand what’s going on, or googling until you do._

### Most Important ADVICE
* Write a lot of code, practice!
* Search Google for the answers
* Ask questions, then more question, and keep asking questions
