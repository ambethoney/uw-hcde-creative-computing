# Setting up your portfolio (as a UW website)
1. Activate your UW shared web hosting
 * Visit myuw.washington.edu
 * Click on "My Account" in the upper right corner
 * Click on "Computing Services" on the left sidebar
 * Check Dante/Vergil Account
 * Check Student Web Publishing
 * Click "Subscribe"

2. Browse to your website
 * Open a browser and visit http://students.washington.edu/netid/ 
  __Note__: replace netid above, with your own netid 
  You should see a page with some text and an under construction icon

3. Connect to the server using SSH
 * Open Cyberduck
 * Click "Open Connection" in the left hand-corner
 * Select SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) in the drop-down menu at the top
 * Type in vergil.u.washington.edu as the server name
 * Enter 22 as the Port number
 * Enter your netid as your username
 * Enter your netid password as your password
 * Click connect
  If you get an unknown host key popup, click "Allow"
			
4. Edit your index.html file
 * Double click on the public_html folder
 * Right-click on index.html, and choose Edit With > Brackets
 * Change some of the text on the page, sharing details about yourself or why you are taking this class

5. Add an image
 * Drag an image (of yourself or something you like) into the Cyberduck window to upload it to your server space
 * Then change one of the images on your site to be the picture of yourself
 * You should use an image stored on your server space, not a web image; ask for help if you need it!
