### Part B
Work through the first 3 Recursion Exercises. These are a little more interesting.

### Part C [Optional]
Try Recursion Exercise 4. This is a more challenging problem, but definitely not impossible.

When you finish the assignment you should submit a screenshot (`.jpg`, or `.png`) on Canvas. If you need help taking a screenshot, ask!
