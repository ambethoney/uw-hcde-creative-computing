## Materials
### Computing Software (all free)
Students will need regular access to a computer with p5.js installed, you will also greatly benefit if you install Cyberduck and Brackets, all three of these pieces of software are freely available to everyone.

* p5.js Editor: <https://p5js.org/download/>

* Cyberduck: <https://cyberduck.io/?l=en> (or another FTP program)

* Brackets: <http://brackets.io/> (or another text editor)

Students are expected to check Slack and GitHub daily for announcements, discussions, and assignments.

## Textbooks
### Optional
* Getting Started with Processing by Casey Reas and Ben Fry, O'Reilly, 2nd or 3rd edition ($2.50 – $19.99 online).
* Learning Processing by Daniel Shiffman ($44.00 online); this book covers a lot more programming than we will have time for, but if you are really interested in the programming and want to keep going with it, I highly recommend this book.

## Grading
General components that will influence your grade:
* Reading, Writing, Discussing, and Thinking in class and on Slack, your thoughtful participation will be of value to all.
* Short programming exercises in class
* Longer programming assignments for homework
* A final project of your choosing, more details will be provided soon, no final exam

The grade weighting is as follows:
* Programming assignments: 45%
* Final Project: 25%
* Presentations: 10%
* In-class quizzes: 10%
* Portfolio Work: 10%

If you have a problem with a grade you received or if you feel the grade you received is incorrect please email the instructor for an appointment to discuss the assignment and your grade in detail. TAs are not able to change or adjust grades, so please do not waste their time by sending them emails or visiting their office hours to request a grade change.

The gradebook on Canvas will be updated regularly; please check it to be sure scores have been recorded correctly.

### Late Work
Late work is not accepted unless under special circumstances. If you need to turn in an assignment late under special circumstances, please email the instructor to schedule a meeting in which we can discuss and determine if extra time is needed.

## Academic Conduct
All work in this class must be your own. All of it. DO NOT COPY! Computers make it trivial to copy digital information—it's an important source of their power. Computers make it trivial to find copying. Penalties are high.

### Academic Integrity
The essence of academic life revolves around respect not only for the ideas of others, but also their rights to those ideas. It is therefore essential that all of us engaged in the life of the mind take the utmost care that the ideas and expressions of ideas of other people always be appropriately handled, and, where necessary, cited. For writing assignments, when ideas or materials of others are used, they must be cited. The format is not that important—as long as the source material can be located and the citation verified, it's OK. What is important is that the material be cited. In any situation, if you have a question, please feel free to ask. Such attention to ideas and acknowledgment of their sources is central not only to academic life, but life in general. Please acquaint yourself with the University of Washington's resources on academic honesty.

### Copyright
All of the expressions of ideas in this class that are fixed in any tangible medium such as digital and physical documents are protected by copyright law as embodied in title 17 of the United States Code. These expressions include the work product of both: (1) your student colleagues (e.g., any assignments published here in the course environment or statements committed to text in a discussion forum); and, (2) your instructors (e.g., the syllabus, assignments, reading lists, and lectures). Within the constraints of "fair use," you may copy these copyrighted expressions for your personal intellectual use in support of your education here in the UW. Such fair use by you does not include further distribution by any means of copying, performance or presentation beyond the circle of your close acquaintances, student colleagues in this class and your family. If you have any questions regarding whether a use to which you wish to put one of these expressions violates the creator's copyright interests, please feel free to ask the instructor for guidance.

### Privacy
To support an academic environment of rigorous discussion and open expression of personal thoughts and feelings, we, as members of the academic community, must be committed to the inviolate right of privacy of our student and instructor colleagues. As a result, we must forego sharing personally identifiable information about any member of our community including information about the ideas they express, their families, lifestyles and their political and social affiliations. If you have any questions regarding whether a disclosure you wish to make regarding anyone in this course or in the university community violates that person's privacy interests, please feel free to ask the instructor for guidance.

Knowingly violating any of these principles of academic conduct, privacy or copyright may result in University disciplinary action under the Student Code of Conduct.

## Accessibility
To request academic accommodations due to a disability, please contact Disabled Student Services: 448 Schmitz, 206-543-8924 (V/TTY). If you have a letter from DSS indicating that you have a disability which requires academic accommodations, please present the letter to me so we can discuss the accommodations you might need in the class.

Academic accommodations due to disability will not be made unless the student has a letter from DSS specifying the type and nature of accommodations needed.
